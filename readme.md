RC API Wrapper
=================

A wrapper for the [Recurse Center API](https://github.com/recursecenter/wiki/wiki/Recurse-Center-API) written in Go. It can handle authenticating with OAuth2 and making requests.

[Here's](https://gist.github.com/JKiely/267083e9fa776eb7d35c38fb8447e57c) an example app using it.


Getting Started
---------------

### Step 0:
[Apply](https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat) and get accepted to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). Done? Exellent. 

### Step 1:
Go to your [RC Settings page](https://www.recurse.com/settings/oauth), look in OAuth applications, and create a new application. You'll need to give it a name and redirect url (it can just be http://localhost:3000/recurse (with whatever port/extention you want) while you're testing.

### Step 2:
This will give you back an ID and a Secret, take these (and you redirect url) and call rc_api.MakeConfig on them, like this:

```Go
MakeConfig(
		"http://localhost:3000/recurse",
		"ID",
		"Secret",
	)
```
You really don't want to expose these so it's probably best to save them as enviroment variables and use `os.Getenv("varName")` to retreve them.

### Step 3: 
In your app, make sure you have a route that redirects the user to the url provided by `rc_api.GetUrl()`. This sends them to a page on the RC website which asks them to log in (if they're not already), and then asks if they give your app permission to access their account.

### Step 4:
After Step 3 recurse.com will redirect the user back to the redirect url you provided, so make sure you have a handler for that as well. It will also pass you a code as a param in the url, your handler will need to take this code and pass it to `rc_api.SetToken(code)`. This package will then use that code to authorize your application and get an authorization token that it will use when you make API requests.

It might look like this:
```Go
func handleRCCallback(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    code := r.FormValue("code")
    rc_api.SetToken(code)
    
    ...
    
    // Whatever you want to do next 
}
```

Using the API
-------------

### Auth


### Recursers

#### Get yourself
```Go
rc_api.GetMe()
```
Returns you! Or at least whoever is logged in. A json object containing all the details pertaining to you.

When I do it it looks like this:
```
{"id":1786,
"first_name":"John",
"middle_name":"",
"last_name":"Kiely",
"email":"jjkiely@gmail.com",
"twitter":null,
"github":"JKiely",
"batch_id":28,
"phone_number":"13476367122",
"has_photo":true,
"interests":null,
"before_rc":null,
"during_rc":null,
"is_faculty":false,
"is_hacker_schooler":true,
"job":null,
"image":"https://d29xw0ra2h4o4u.cloudfront.net/assets/people/john_kiely_150-fe5be2ceba10783d19ad16dd2511c2a118a66258926a367a2a6a40811b8b4729.jpg",
"batch":{"id":28,"name":"Summer 2, 2016","start_date":"2016-07-05","end_date":"2016-09-22"},
"pseudonym":"Pvc Drop",
"current_location":null,
"stints":[{"batch_id":28,"start_date":"2016-07-05","end_date":"2016-09-22"}],
"projects":[],"links":[],"skills":[],"bio":null}
```

#### Get any Recurser
```Go
rc_api.GetRecurser("id")
```
Gets a Recurser who you spesify by their id (given as a string) or their email address.

(The `GetMe` function above is really just this one, but passing in "me" as the id.)

### Batches

#### Get a batch
```Go
rc_api.GetBatch("id")
```
Gets the given batch as a, as specified by the batch ID for example if called with "28" it will return:
```
{"id":28,
"name":"Summer 2, 2016",
"start_date":"2016-07-05",
"end_date":"2016-09-22"}
```

#### Get Recursers from batch
```Go
rc_api.GetBatchMembers("id")
```
Takes a batch id as a string and returns a list of every recurser in a given batch.

#### Get every batch
```Go
rc_api.GetBatchList()
```
Returns a list of every batch.
